# Bearable

Bearbale is a lesson style blog that aims to make the first year of engineering more bareable. As Chemical Engineering students, we've come to find that traditional lecture and learning styles tend to rush through concepts without allowing students to get a deeper appreciation for the concepts importance. Bearable aims create a greater connection of concepts together by dividing up concepts into theory and application components.

The website itself is built using NextJS, Tailwind in addition to using Contentlayer to display MDX style lessons formatted using various Remark and Rehype plugins.
