# Teaching Philosophy

## Introduction
I believe that the way people are taught in university right now is not optimal. Professors focus on either rote memorization, not of facts but of problem types, or they overemphasize theory to the point of abandoning practical applications.

## How To Fix This

Learning needs to be separated into 3 major categories for each topic:
- What are we learning (Theory)
- Why are we learning it (Applications)
- How do we do it (Practice)

## Learning Styles

In addition to splitting up lessons, there should also be multiple options on how to learn each section.

For example, some people learn via reading notes, some people read the textbook, some people solve problems, some people watch videos teaching content, and some people watch videos solving problems.

These options should all be present on Bearable, to allow for as multidimensional an approach to learning as desired.

## Structure

So to accomplish this, here is the general flow of a bearable lesson:

1. Introduce Topic, explain general idea and a basic way it can be used
2. Provide links/TOC to 3 sections which are: 
   1. Theory
   2. Applications
   3. Practice
3. Theory section will describe why everything works the way it does. (Derivations, theorems, reasoning)
4. Applications section will describe why we do things, and what its used for. This includes applications for other concepts in the course, as well as practical applications for industry. 
5. Practice Section will contain:
   1. How to do problems
   2. Worked examples
   3. Practice problems
   4. Challenging problem

## Questions/Uncertainties

- Should the entire lecture be on one page, or separate pages?
- Should each section be somewhat equal lengths, or different?
- Will people be overwhelmed by the amount of content?
- How do we encourage active learning vs rote memorization?
- What platform will videos be made with? As in how will we demonstrate concepts?
