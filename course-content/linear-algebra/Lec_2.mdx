## Where to Start?

As we covered before, linear algebra is not only really important, but also quite difficult. So to begin, we're going to cover all the basic concepts you'll need to succeed.
This includes vectors, matrices, and basic operations you can do with them.

## Vectors

You may have heard of vectors before in physics class, or maybe from [_Despicable Me_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9QoYL_8tI), as a quantity that has both direction and magnitude.

However, vectors are more than just the basic ones used in physics, that only represent 2 quantities. As we know, linear algebra is all about going into higher dimensions, and so the definition of a vector in linear algebra is simply a structure that contains values in some number of dimensions (typically greater than 1). They are represented in either of the following ways:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
1 \\
0 \\
\end{bmatrix} 
\quad
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

These are examples of 3 dimensional vectors, as they have 3 numbers in them. We'll get more into dimensions later, but for now just understand that vectors can be in any number of dimensions.

In linear algebra we use vectors to hold large amounts of information, like if we need to decide the color of something. RGB values are a 3 dimensional vector used to describe a color based on how red, green, and blue it is.

## Dimensions
In linear algebra we talk about dimensions frequently, so its important you understand exactly what it means. A dimension is essentially something we can store information about. For example, the velocit vectors you learned in physics have 2 dimensions. It only had a width and a height. However, digital representation of color is a 3 dimensional quality, as it tells you how red, green, and blue something is.

If a vector has 2 dimensions, we say it is a vector in $$ \mathbb{R^2} $$ (pronounced "R two"), if it has 4 dimensions it's in $$\mathbb{R^4}$$ and so on.

Dimensions will matter much more later on, but for now that's all you need to know about them. For some quick examples, vector v is in $$\mathbb{R^6}$$ and vector u is in $$\mathbb{R^3}$$.

$$
v = 
\begin{bmatrix}
3 & 2 & 3 & 8 & 3 & 12\\
\end{bmatrix} 
\quad
u=
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & 2 & 7 \\
\end{bmatrix} 
$$



## Matrices

Matrices are the next step up from vectors, and they can get confusing really fast. A matrix (singular form of matrices) is a set of numbers arranged in a certain way to make them useful.

They look like this:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0\\
0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix} 
$$


A matrix can have any positive number of rows and columns, and is referred to as an nxm matrix, where n is number of rows and m is number of columns.
So here is a 3x2 matrix, A, and a 2x5 matrix, B:

$$
A = 
\begin{bmatrix}
9 & 0 \\
2 & 1 \\
0 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix} 
\quad
B=
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0\\
0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix} 
$$

Vectors are also techincally matrices, but with only 1 row or column. C is a 3x1 matrix, or a column vector in $$\mathbb{R^3}$$ and D is a 1x2 matrix, or a row vector in $$\mathbb{R^2}$$

$$
C = 
\begin{bmatrix}
4\\
2\\
0\\
\end{bmatrix} 
\quad
D=
\begin{bmatrix}
6 & 9\\
\end{bmatrix} 
$$

Representing what matrices mean is a little bit harder. Matrices are essentially maps, that take you from one vector to another. Consider a case where you need to predict the color of a leaf based on the size and weight. You have a vector in $$\mathbb{R^2}$$ representing the size and weight, and you want a vector in $$\mathbb{R^3}$$ with the RGB values of the color. So you have to go from a $$\mathbb{R^2}$$ vector to a $$\mathbb{R^3}$$ vector, and to do this you need some sort of map, or system of equations, that describes how to get there. This is what matrices are for, and in fact a 3x2 matrix is what you need. We'll see how to do this math later on this lesson, but for now understand that:
__Matrices are "linear maps" that take you from one vector to another, regardless of dimension.__

## Vector Operations

We can do math with vectors similar to how you can do math with numbers. First, we can add two vectors of the same dimension together by adding each number to its corresponding one, like this:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
2\\
3\\
\end{bmatrix} 
+
\begin{bmatrix}
-4\\
2\\
\end{bmatrix} 
=
\begin{bmatrix}
-2\\
5\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Subtraction works the exact same way, but multiplication is different, because there are 3 different kinds. __You cannot always multiply 2 vectors together.__

Scalar multiplication, which is when you multiply a normal number by a vector, is quite simple and is done elementwise like addition:

$$
4 * 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1\\
2\\
4\\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
-4\\
8\\
16\\
\end{bmatrix} 
$$

You cant divide with vectors, but you can multiply by a fraction or a decimal:
$$
\frac{3}{4} * 
\begin{bmatrix}
-4\\
3\\
8\\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
-3\\
\frac{9}{4}\\
6\\
\end{bmatrix} 
$$

This matters because its just as important as normal addition or multiplication, and we'll use it in literally everything in linear algebra.

Now we need to discuss the other 2 kinds of vector multiplication, the __dot product__ and the __cross product__.

### Dot Product
The dot product is an operation that can be done on 2 vectors with the same dimension, by multiplying each corresponding element together and summing the results.

For example:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
-1\\
2\\
\end{bmatrix}
\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
-3\\
-1\\
\end{bmatrix} 
=
$$

$$
(-1 \cdot -3) + (2 \cdot -1) = 
$$

$$
3 - 2 = 1
$$

The dot product cannot be done with vectors of different sizes as not all numbers will match up. The dot product also __returns a scalar, even though we are multiplying 2 vectors.__

### Cross Product

## Matrix Operations

Matrices can be multiplied by scalars just like vectors, elementwise:

$$
\frac{1}{3} * 
\begin{bmatrix}
-6 & 3\\
2 & 9\\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
-2 & 1\\
\frac{2}{3} & 3\\
\end{bmatrix} 
$$

But they cant always be multiplied, their dimensions have to agree.

To understand this, we need to understand how to multiply matrices.

### Matrix multiplication
Lets start with 2 'square' matrices of the same size. A square matrix is a matrix with the same number of rows as columns.

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 0\\
1 & 2\\
\end{bmatrix}
\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
3 & 2\\
0 & -5\\
\end{bmatrix} 
$$

This multiplication will give us a new 2x2 square matrix, with each entry corresponding to the dot product of a row and a column.
