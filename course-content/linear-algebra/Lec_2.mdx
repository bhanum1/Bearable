## Where to Start?

As we covered before, linear algebra is not only really important, but also quite difficult. So to begin, we're going to cover all the basic concepts you'll need to succeed.
This includes vectors, matrices, and basic operations you can do with them.

## Vectors

You may have heard of vectors before in physics class, or maybe from [_Despicable Me_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw9QoYL_8tI), as a quantity that has both direction and magnitude.

However, vectors are more than just the basic ones used in physics, that only represent 2 quantities. As we know, linear algebra is all about going into higher dimensions, and so the definition of a vector in linear algebra is simply a structure that contains values in some number of dimensions (typically greater than 1). They are represented in either of the following ways:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
1 \\
0 \\
\end{bmatrix} 
\quad
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

These are examples of 3 dimensional vectors, as they have 3 numbers in them. We'll get more into dimensions later, but for now just understand that vectors can be in any number of dimensions.

In linear algebra we use vectors to hold large amounts of information, like if we need to decide the color of something. RGB values are a 3 dimensional vector used to describe a color based on how red, green, and blue it is.

## Dimensions
In linear algebra we talk about dimensions frequently, so its important you understand exactly what it means. A dimension is essentially something we can store information about. For example, the velocit vectors you learned in physics have 2 dimensions. It only had a width and a height. However, digital representation of color is a 3 dimensional quality, as it tells you how red, green, and blue something is.

If a vector has 2 dimensions, we say it is a vector in $$ \mathbb{R^2} $$ (pronounced "R two"), if it has 4 dimensions it's in $$\mathbb{R^4}$$ and so on.

Dimensions will matter much more later on, but for now that's all you need to know about them. For some quick examples, vector v is in $$\mathbb{R^6}$$ and vector u is in $$\mathbb{R^3}$$.

$$
v = 
\begin{bmatrix}
3 & 2 & 3 & 8 & 3 & 12\\
\end{bmatrix} 
\quad
u=
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & 2 & 7 \\
\end{bmatrix} 
$$



## Matrices

Matrices are the next step up from vectors, and they can get confusing really fast. A matrix (singular form of matrices) is a set of numbers arranged in a certain way to make them useful.

They look like this:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0\\
0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix} 
$$


A matrix can have any positive number of rows and columns, and is referred to as an nxm matrix, where n is number of rows and m is number of columns.
So here is a 3x2 matrix, A, and a 2x5 matrix, B:

$$
A = 
\begin{bmatrix}
9 & 0 \\
2 & 1 \\
0 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix} 
\quad
B=
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0\\
0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix} 
$$

Vectors are also techincally matrices, but with only 1 row or column. C is a 3x1 matrix, or a column vector in $$\mathbb{R^3}$$ and D is a 1x2 matrix, or a row vector in $$\mathbb{R^2}$$

$$
C = 
\begin{bmatrix}
4\\
2\\
0\\
\end{bmatrix} 
\quad
D=
\begin{bmatrix}
6 & 9\\
\end{bmatrix} 
$$

Representing what matrices mean is a little bit harder. Matrices are essentially maps, that take you from one vector to another. Consider a case where you need to predict the color of a leaf based on the size and weight. You have a vector in $$\mathbb{R^2}$$ representing the size and weight, and you want a vector in $$\mathbb{R^3}$$ with the RGB values of the color. So you have to go from a $$\mathbb{R^2}$$ vector to a $$\mathbb{R^3}$$ vector, and to do this you need some sort of map, or system of equations, that describes how to get there. This is what matrices are for, and in fact a 3x2 matrix is what you need. We'll see how to do this math later on this lesson, but for now understand that:
__Matrices are "linear maps" that take you from one vector to another, regardless of dimension.__
