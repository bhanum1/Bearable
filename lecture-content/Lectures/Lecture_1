# What is Linear Algebra?
 
Linear algebra is, essentially, the study of linear equations, how they relate to each other, and how to manipulate them. This is a bit of an oversimplification, because there's a million different things that fall under this umbrella, but I find it helps to understand the course a little bit.

This is because, unfortunately, linear algebra is one of the hardest math courses you'll have to take if you don't fully understand what's going on. But it's also one of the most powerful forms of math and is used in countless different industries today.

## The Theory Behind Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is all about linear equations. The beauty of linear equations is that they're an extremely simple way to represent complicated data. 
$$ ax + by = c \qquad \& \qquad y=mx+b$$

This simple equation, and its rearranged form, can be used to represent nearly unlimited things, like distance traveled by a car, force needed to stretch a spring, or predicting height of a tree.

However, it gets even more powerful when we go to **_higher dimensions_**. This sounds really fancy but it just means when we have the equations depend on more than 1 variable, like having: 

$$ ax + by + cz = d $$

This simple idea is where the basics of linear algebra begin, and we'll cover it in much more detail in further lessons, but for now lets see why more dimensions matters.

## Why Use Linear Algebra?

Linear algebra is used in many industries, so I'm quickly going to just list a few and a keyword in case you'd like to google it to know more:

- Game design: Vector math & 3d graphics
- Genetic engineering: Systems biology & stoichiometric matrices
- Economics: Linear programming & optimization
- Data science: Regressions & linearizations
- Computer science: Vectors & singal analysis
- And many many many more.

Any field that uses math to solve a problem will likely use linear algebra as well, so it's very important that you get a solid understanding of it.

## Test stuff for Big C

Here are some matrices: 

$$
\begin{matrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6 \\
7 & 8 & 9
\end{matrix}
$$

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{5}{6} & \frac{1}{6} & 0 \\[0.3em]
\frac{5}{6} & 0 & \frac{1}{6} \\[0.3em]
0 & \frac{5}{6} & \frac{1}{6}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Here are some vectors:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
1 \\
0 \\
\end{bmatrix} $$

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix} $$
